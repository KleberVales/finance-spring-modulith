# Financial System with Spring Modulith

A financial application built with Spring Boot using Spring Modulith architecture — a modular monolith approach to organizing domain-centric services + business logic.

This project demonstrates how to structure and scale a Spring application using modules while keeping a single deployable artifact.

## 🚀 Features

- Modular monolith architecture using Spring Modulith
- Domain-driven module organization
- Event-driven communication between modules
- Individual module unit & integration testing
- Docker support with compose for easy setup

## 🧱 What is Spring Modulith?

Spring Modulith helps you structure Spring Boot applications into logical modules with clear boundaries — combining the benefits of a monolith with modular organization patterns.

Benefits include:

- Better maintainability and code organization
- Reduced coupling between domains
- Module-level testing support
- Clear domain boundaries and event interaction
